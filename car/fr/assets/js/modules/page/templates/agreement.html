            place. The driving licence must have been issued by authorised authorities at least

            12 months before the date of the commencement of the rental. In addition to the

            normal driving licence, an international driving licence is also mandatory if the

            driving licence is written in a language different to the one of Cyprus and/or in

            characters that can not be read. Please note that the international driving licence is

            <h3>3. THE VEHICLE: CONDITION, USE, BREAKDOWN ASSISTANCE AND

            MAINTENANCE/MECHANICAL PROBLEMS</h3>

            3.1 Condition of the Vehicle.

            A description of the condition of the Vehicle will be given to you at the same time as

            the rental agreement.

            Before leaving the rental location, you are required to check the condition of the

            Vehicle. Where an apparent defect is found which is not already listed in the

            document, you must immediately inform the CYBAY employee at the counter in

            order to proceed with a joint-examination of the Vehicle.

            In such a case, amendments must be made to the document and duly

            countersigned by both parties.

            If the amended document is not countersigned by both parties, the condition of the

            Vehicle will be as set out in the document given to you with the rental agreement

            and it will be considered that you received the Vehicle in proper working condition.

            You will return the Vehicle in the same condition as it was provided at the start of

            the rental.  You are responsible for any repair or refurbishment costs and these will

            be added to the cost of the rental.

            3.2 Use of the Vehicle

            The Vehicle must not be driven by anyone other than you and then only under the

            condition that your ability to drive is not in any way impaired by mental or physical

            incapacity or restricted by the Law.

            You must take care of the Vehicle, keep it in good repair and condition, pay any

            fines for which you may be liable, reimburse CYBAY for any damage to the Vehicle,

            and refund CYBAY for any costs it incurs.

            The Vehicle will be provided to you with a full fuel tank. You must only refuel the

            Vehicle with the correct type of fuel. Costs

            of fuel and for the refuelling service will be at your expense if the Vehicle is not

            returned with a full tank.

            CYBAY strongly recommends that you carefully read this information available at

            the CYBAY counter.

            You are liable for all fees, taxes, fines and penalties incurred in connection with the

            use of the Vehicle and for which CYBAY is charged, unless they have arisen

            through the fault of CYBAY.

            During the rental period you must carry out the usual checks (engine oil level, tire

            pressure, etc.) as would any careful user and you must respect the maintenance

            cycle of the Vehicle as stated in the maintenance guide, if any.

            When parking the Vehicle, even for a short period, you undertake to lock it and

            make use of the Vehicle&#39;s alarm and/or immobilisation equipment. You must never

            leave the Vehicle unoccupied with the keys in the ignition. Non-return of the keys

            will lead to invalidation of the theft cover.

            You undertake to use the Vehicle in a responsible manner and in particular, only for

            the purposes for which it is intended. For a car, this means primarily carrying

            passengers other than for hire and reward.

            In particular, you must not use the Vehicle under any of the following conditions or

            for any of the following purposes:

             driving the Vehicle under the influence of alcohol, drugs or any other

            type of narcotic substances,

             transportation of inflammable or dangerous goods, as well as toxic,

            corrosive, radioactive or other harmful substances,

             carrying anything which, because of its smell or condition, harms the

            Vehicle or causes CYBAY to lose time or money before it can rent the

            Vehicle again,

             transportation of live animals (with the exception of domestic pets,

            subject to prior authorisation by CYBAY),

             with a roof rack, luggage carrier or similar, unless supplied by CYBAY,

             re-rental to or use by other persons,

             carrying passengers for hire or reward,

              participating in rallies, competitions or trials, wherever they may take

            place,

             giving driving lessons,

             pushing or towing another vehicle (except those vehicles equipped by

            CYBAY with a towing-hook; maximum load 1,000 kg), or exceeding the

            authorised load weight.

              travelling on non-paved roads or on roads, the surface or state of repair

            of which could put the vehicle&#39;s wheels, tires or its under body

            mechanics at risk,

             intentionally committing any offence.

             none of the goods and baggage carried in the Vehicle, including their

            packing and stowage equipment, will be permitted to damage the

            Vehicle, nor put the occupants abnormally at risk,

             in any way which breaks the highway Code, road traffic laws or any

            other laws.

            You will be liable for any offence committed during the rental period which

            relates in any way to your use of the Vehicle, as if you were the owner of the

            Vehicle. Upon the request of the Police or any official body CYBAY may have

            to transfer your personal data.

            3.3 Maintenance / Mechanical Problems

            The Vehicle has been provided to you with a full set of ties in good condition.

            In the event that any of them is damaged for any reason other than normal

            wear and tear, you undertake to replace it immediately at your own expense

            with a tire of the same dimensions, type and wear characteristics.

            You must stop the Vehicle if any of the instrument panel warning lights, which

            are intended to indicate the existence of a mechanical problem, light up, or if

            you become aware ofanything else which may indicate the presence of a

            mechanical problem with the Vehicle.

            If the odometer has stopped functioning for any reason other than a technical

            failure, you will be required to pay a distance charge according to the rates in

            force in the country of rental.

            When the rental starts, the Vehicle will be roadworthy and fit for normal use. If

            it is not, or if it becomes un-roadworthy or unfit for normal use during the rental

            because of mechanical breakdown or accident, you must inform CYBAY

            station or telephone the emergency number shown on the wallet of the rental

            agreement.

            CYBAY will have the choice between replacing the Vehicle or accepting

            repairs to be done to the Vehicle. In the latter case, repairs can only be made

            after written or oral confirmation from and instructions given by CYBAY as well

            as prior acceptation by CYBAY of the estimation of costs. You must be able to

            provide the name and station name of CYBAY accepting therepairs. Without

            prejudice to any question of liability, the expenses for the repairs may be

            charged directly to CYBAY. If not, CYBAY reserves the right to request from

            you the remittance of the defective pieces and the paid invoice.

            The fees and expenses of any repair undertaken without the order of CYBAY

            will not be reimbursed to you.

            You must inform CYBAY, of all accidents, damage to or breakdowns of the

            car, even those which may already have been repaired, when you return the

            Vehicle. You will remain liable for any damages to CYBAY.

            In any case, neither CYBAY nor its directors, officers or employees will be

            liable to you for any loss or damage (including but not limited to loss of profit

            or earnings...) nor, to the extent permitted by the Law, for indirect

            consequential damages whether your action is based on contract or in tort.

            4.4 Breakdown Assistance

            For the length of the rental, as agreed with CYBAY, you have the benefit, at

            no extra cost, of a Breakdown and Assistance Service. If required, this service

            can be contacted by calling the telephone number indicated on the wallet of

            the rental agreement or on the windscreen or on the key holder.

            In order to benefit from this cover, you must make contact with the Breakdown

            and Assistance Service immediately after the occurrence of the incident. If you

            do not contact the Breakdown and Assistance Service and if you initiate steps

            or make any disbursements without the prior consent of CYBAY, you will not

            be able to claim for reimbursement of the expenses. The rule of prior approval

            does not apply in the event of breakdown on motorways and solely in this

            case. Consequently, the roadside repair or towing expenses will be

            reimbursed to you.

            <h3>5. RENTAL PERIOD</h3>

            5.1  Principle and Calculation

            You undertake to return the Vehicle to CYBAY at the agreed place, on the

            date and at the time indicated on the rental agreement.

            The maximum duration of a rental agreement may vary from one country to

            another. The rental duration is calculated on the basis of indivisible periods of

            24 hours, starting from the time the Vehicle is made available. However, a 30

            minute grace period is applied at the end of the rental before the start of a new

            24-Hour period.

            5.2  Extension of the Original Duration of the Rental

            Should you wish to keep the Vehicle for a period longer than that originally set out in

            the rental agreement, you are must first contact by phone CYBAY in order to extend

            the duration of the rental agreement.

            The Vehicle is insured for the period mentioned on the rental agreement. Unless

            otherwise agreed in writing by CYBAY, once this period is passed, the contracting

            party remains liable for any damages to CYBAY

            5.3 Delivery and Collection Terms

            Where you ask CYBAY and CYBAY agrees in writing to deliver the Vehicle or to

            collect t he Vehicle, you may have to pay additional charges and follow

            additional instructions. You must check at the time of reservation.

            When you return the Vehicle, or if CYBAY has agreed you will do so, when you

            leave the Vehicle for collection by CYBAY, you must complete the details of the

            date and time of return, the mileage and fuel gauge reading and other information

            shown on the rental document wallet. You must also do anything else, which

            CYBAY requests as a condition of agreeing to collect the Vehicle.

            You must return the Vehicle immediately if CYBAY asks you to do so. In the event

            that the Vehicle is not delivered to CYBAY upon request you hereby authorise

            CYBAY to enter your premises and to do any and all other things necessary to

            repossess the Vehicle. You will be liable for any costs associated with such

            repossession. CYBAY may repossess any vehicle without notice or liability where

            CYBAY deems that such repossession is necessary for its own protection.

            5.4 End of Rental

            The end of the rental is defined by the return of the Vehicle and of its keys to the

            rental counter at the agreed CYBAY location. This must be done to a uniformed

            CYBAY employee and under no circumstances should you give the keys to any

            person present at the CYBAY location and who you assume or who purports to be a

            CYBAY employee.

            If the Vehicle is returned without its keys, you will be invoiced for the cost of the

            replacement keys.

            5.4.1  In the event of confiscation, theft or accident

            In the event of measures by third parties, including attachment, confiscation or

            impounding of the Vehicle, you must immediately inform CYBAY in writing. CYBAY

            will then be entitled to take all measures which it deems necessary to protect its

            rights. You will be liable for all damage, cost and/or expenses associated with the

            above measures and for any

            direct, indirect, consequential damages (such as loss...) to the Vehicle unless it is

            demonstrated that CYBAY is directly responsible for such confiscation or

            impounding of the Vehicle.

            Furthermore, the rental agreement may be automatically terminated as soon as

            CYBAY is informed of such action by the legal authorities or by you.

            Any use of the Vehicle which may be detrimental to CYBAY will entitle CYBAY to

            automatically terminate the rental agreement with immediate effect. You will then

            return the Vehicle immediately as soon as CYBAY so requests.

            In the event of theft of the Vehicle, the rental agreement will be terminated as soon

            as CYBAY has received a copy of the theft declaration made by you to the police

            authorities.

            In the event of an accident, the rental agreement will be terminated as soon as

            CYBAY has received a copy of the accident report completed by you and, where

            applicable, the third party. If CYBAY provides a new vehicle, the rental agreement

            will be amended accordingly.

            Furthermore CYBAY will have no responsibility for loss, theft, robbery or damage of

            whatever nature relating to objects and/or utensils transported or which are found in

            the Vehicle including, in particular, baggage and/or goods.

            <h3>6. RATES / TERMS OF PAYMENT</h3>

            6.1 RatesThe total charges for each rental will be determined according to the price

            list applicable at the time of rental. If you do not meet the preconditions for a

            contractual rate, then the standard rate is to be paid.

            6.2 Terms of Payment

            When payment is made by means of a credit card, an authorisation will be

            requested prior to the start of the rental.

            The minimum amount of the authorisation will be determined by multiplying the rate

            by the rental period reserved by you and other relevant charges. This amount is not

            debited. It is held on cardholder&#39;s bank account until the final rental charge amount

            is debited.

            When the Vehicle is returned, the invoiced amount will be charged to the credit card

            provided, unless you present another means of payment.

            In the event of non-payment by the due date shown on the invoice, you will be

            liable, for payment of interest on the due amount in accordance with the details on

            the invoice, if any.

            Non-payment by due date of any invoice or any other non-payment will render all

            outstanding invoices due immediately and will authorise CYBAY to require

            immediate return of any vehicles still on rent and to terminate the agreements

            relating to such rentals.

            The tariffs applicable to the rental, to the additional services and to the optional

            covers or insurances are those which are in force on the date of issue of the rental

            agreement, and correspond to the characteristics you originally indicated at the time

            of reservation (Vehicle type rental, duration, return station...). Any modification in the

            characteristics will entail the use of an appropriate alternative tariff.

            Should the Vehicle not be returned with a full fuel tank, you will be charged for the

            missing quantity of fuel and for the refuelling service according to the tariffs in force

            in the country of rental, unless you have subscribed to the full tank option.

            All the vehicles in CYBAY’s fleet are insured against Bodily Injury and/or

            Property Damage that you might inflict on a third party as a result of an

            accident involving the Vehicle.

            7.1  Liability in the Event of Damage to the Rental Vehicle or Theft

            or Conversion thereof

            7.1.1 You will be liable for any damages to CYBAY when renting a

            Vehicle that has been entrusted to you.

            Therefore, in the event of theft of the Vehicle or damages caused to it,

            you must fully indemnify CYBAY (the indemnification will include the

            amounts corresponding to the repair costs, resale value of the Vehicle,

            loss of use, administration charges...).

            The amount will not exceed the market value of the rented vehicle at the

            time of the event.

            You are advised that any waivers you may have chosen will be

            Invalidated if you fail to take reasonable measures for the safety of the

            Vehicle, its parts or accessories, or fail to comply with all restrictions on

            the use of the Vehicle or otherwise abuse or misuse it.

            You will not be exempt from liability towards CYBAY in the case of

            breach of contract. Therefore, you will be responsible for any financial

            loss CYBAY suffers as a result of such breach and for any relevant

            claims made by other people. You agree to pay any amounts CYBAY

            spends in enforcing these terms.

            THEREFORE IN ANY CASE, NEITHER CYBAY NOR ITS OFFICERS,

            DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES WILL BE LIABLE TO THE CONTRACTING

            PARTY FOR ANY AMOUNTS NOR FOR ANY ACTIONS, LAW SUITS

            OR CLAIMS RELATED TO ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

            CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE DAMAGES (SUCH AS LOSS OF

            BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFIT) ARISING OUT OF OR IN

            CONNECTION WITH THE RENTAL OR THE USE OF ANY VEHICLE

            WHEHER THE ACTION IS BASED ON CONTRACT OR IN TORT. YOU

            WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD EUROPCAR HARMLESS FROM ALL

            CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING

            OUT OF THE RENTAL AND/OR THE USE OF THE VEHICLE.

            If the loss suffered by CYBAY is subsequently reduced (recovery of the

            Vehicle within 60 days, partial or total liability on the part of the Third

            party), you will receive the corresponding reimbursement.

            7.1.2 Light damage (valid only if applicable)

            Both at check-out and check-in CYBAY will, together with you, record in

            the rental agreement all visible light damage to a vehicle in compliance

            with the detailed list of light damages and repair costs displayed at the

            counter which you hereby acknowledge.

            At check-out unrepaired damage must appear on the rental agreement

            with the appropriate signatures by you and CYBAY. At the end of the

            rental i.e., at check-in, the identification of any new light damage must

            be added to the rental agreement. Any new light damage will be

            immediately pointed out to CYBAY, mentioned in the rental agreement,

            and signed by you and CYBAY. This damage will be charged to you at

            the repair price mentioned in the list displayed at the counter. Where this

            option is available, you will approve by signing electronically or by

            signing the relevant paper document.

            These repair costs will be directly billed to you by CYBAY and will

            include the cost of the damage repair as well as administration charges,

            immobilisation costs, spare parts and labour costs. The above-

            mentioned invoiced repair costs are payable under the same conditions

            as for the payment of the rental agreement.

            8. DATA PROTECTION LAW

            Please note that in the course of the performance of the booking as well

            as the rental process, CYBAY collects some personal data. It is

            mandatory to provide all the information requested; in the absence of

            such information, CYBAY will not be able to correctly ensure the booking

            and/or the rental.

            In order to allow us to provide you with effective services, CYBAY may

            from time to time transfer data collected to other companies in the EU or

            outside the EU. This transfer does not imply any restriction and our

            privacy policy will be fully applicable. By accepting these General Rental

            Terms, you hereby authorize CYBAY International to proceed with such

            a transfer.
