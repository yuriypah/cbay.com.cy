•       The listing, and the web site(s) at the URLs included as part of the listing, if any, must not contain any content, products, services, or other information that in cbay.com.cy's reasonable determination may be illegal to sell under any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation, that may infringe or violate anyone's rights, or that cbay.com.cy believes, in its sole discretion, is inflammatory, offensive, or otherwise inconsistent with the spirit of the Service.<br />
